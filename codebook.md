===================

### Subject
Numbers 1 - 30  
Number assigned to the subject who generated the data.

### Activity
One of six types of text  
Activity performed by the subject while the measurement was taken.
* laying
* sitting
* standing
* walking
* walking_downstairs
* walking_upstairs

All following variables are the average of all observations for said variable for a specific subject doing a specific activity.
